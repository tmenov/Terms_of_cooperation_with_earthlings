Conditions for accepting the Earth into an interstellar union
I will repeat once again simple conditions repeated many times.

1. Ending all military conflicts on Earth and starting the processing of highly dangerous types of weapons, including nuclear and bactereological.
2. Stopping the propaganda of violence and creating a negative image of representatives of extraterrestrial civilizations in the media.
3. Putting things in order in the Earth's ecology: creating factories for processing solid household waste, 
searching for alternative types of engines for transport, all possible measures to reduce emissions from chemical plants, 
combating the greenhouse effect caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
4. Changing the attitude of the state apparatus to the person, the implementation of the principle: 
"Power for the people", the maximum departure from the concept of "people for power". 
The adoption of laws that really protect the weakest people in society.
5. Abolition of the death penalty in all states of the planet Earth. 
The introduction of long or life sentences instead, with compulsory physical labor according to the prisoners' abilities or training in such abilities.
6. Respect for human life from the moment of conception.
7. Abolition of all totalitarian regimes. Mandatory freedom of speech and freedom of conscience.

Mass contact with the Earth is possible only with the permission of the interstellar union, 
which will give it no earlier than five years after the last military conflict on the planet.

The Stars are behind us.
