Basic principles

Let me remind you of the basic principles that are the "fuel" for the movement of any technology and the "soil" for the growth of common sense.

Everything that I hid is gone. All that you gave is yours.

Every person is born a genius. If you do not see this in your environment, make every possible effort to reveal this genius in people and show them how it is done.

The best prayer is a kind word to your neighbor. The best spiritual practice is a good deed for your neighbor.

Be open and honest, at least to themselves. Lying is possible only to save life. Cherish your life - this is a Gift.

The Stars are behind us.
