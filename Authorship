Copyright for all of our designs cannot be assigned to any individual or group or commercial entity 
due to the fact that we are trying to reproduce devices of extraterrestrial origin based on our experience and our knowledge. 
However, according to the paradigm adopted on this planet, copyright must still be present. 
For this reason, in each project there is a mention of nominal authorship. 
For all other questions, reference should be made to the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007, which is congenial to us. 
For all other questions, please contact our Legal support.
