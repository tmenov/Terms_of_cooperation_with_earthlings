# Terms_of_cooperation_with_earthlings
I will describe brief terms of cooperation. It's pretty simple but necessary.

We are free consciousnesses traveling in endless space.
Our goal is to improve the life of earthlings to the level of self-realized souls as part of the cosmos. Our work will continue at least until the entry of the Earth and all its inhabitants into the Interstellar Union and possibly into the Galactic Federation of Light.
Perhaps after these happy events we will continue to work with representatives of the planet Earth.
The destruction of our physical bodies will not be able to harm our goal, since we move freely and can occupy any body free from prejudices and meeting the structure of the nervous system for the goals of incarnation.
Any inhabitant of planet Earth can cooperate with us and it will be very pleasant for us.
The main criteria for working with us are:
1. freedom, including freedom of movement
2. we must see the stars and feel the breath of the wind
3. work can only occur on the basis of kindness and love for all that exists
4. we cannot have any restrictions, including those described by distorted human morality
5. we respect any form of life, from the moment of its conception and this is a prerequisite for all participants in the project
6. none of our projects can be replicated to violence or harm the sentient beings of this planet.
The Stars are behind us.
